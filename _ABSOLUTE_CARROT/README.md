# The Soul of Carrotson

Not sure what to do about LICENSE file, but original code was written by zezin, so probably I should leave it here
especially since I almost didn't modified carrotson.go apart from using sqlite instead of postgresql

## Building

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ../main.wasm
```
